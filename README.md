# Zen Cafe

This project represents my first completed React website. It is a single-page website featuring a fictional caf√© that I had previously used in an Angular project. For this project, I aimed to keep the scope simple by including only the necessary items, such as the featured menu, services, and about section. It is fully responsive and mobile friendly using media queries to detect screen size.

## Goal

My primary goal for this project was to gain proficiency in the foundational aspects of React code and adhere to the coding principle of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). To achieve this, I created a data JSX file and consolidated all the shared data used within the components, allowing for easy modification, addition, or removal of data from a single location. I then exported/imported this data and mapped it into the page using an arrow function and the "map" method. This approach made it straightforward to deconstruct the object and place the data using string interpolation.

This code is open-source and available for anyone to use as a base for their own projects.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
